the chances are your quest is complete.Â NH English DictionaryÂ  is a piece of software that does precisely this, and you may want to take a look at it. 
NH English Dictionary is an online dictionary. This application does not have its own database. It uses an online dictionary API to get the data. 
It is a lightweight and simple application that helps to fulfill the user's daily needs by providing meaning. Letâ€™s start by taking a glimpse of 
the programâ€™s user interface. It should be pointed out that a limited set of controls are included in it, which, from our point of view, is 
the natural choice if you want to focus on the learning process itself. It has a simple layout where you find the search box to search the meaning.
