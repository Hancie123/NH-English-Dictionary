<h2>NH English Dictionary</h2>
<div class="about">
<p>If you have embarked on a drive to learn an English language, you first and foremost need to have some 
linguistic resources at your fingertips, and by this, we mean a capable dictionary.
If you happen to look for an English dictionary that works smoothly and helps you learn 
new words in the blink of an eye, the chances are your quest is complete. NH English Dictionary 
is a piece of software that does precisely this, and you may want to take a look at it.
    
NH English Dictionary is an online dictionary. This application does not have its own database. 
It uses an online dictionary API to get the data. It is a lightweight and simple application that 
helps to fulfill the user's daily needs by providing meaning.
    
Let’s start by taking a glimpse of the program’s user interface. It should be pointed out that a 
limited set of controls are included in it, which, from our point of view, is the natural choice 
if you want to focus on the learning process itself. It has a simple layout where you find the search box to search the meaning.</p>
